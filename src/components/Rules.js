// If the cell is alive and has 2 or 3 neighbors, then it remains alive. Else it dies.
// If the cell is dead and has exactly 3 neighbors, then it comes to life. Else if remains dead.

//MVP
//[X] Application includes a section outlining the rules to Conway's "Game of Life"

//[X] Display includes a text area that shows the current generation of cells being displayed

//[X] Display includes a grid of cells, at least 25x25, that can be toggled to be alive or dead

//[X] Display includes working buttons that start / stop the animation and clear the grid

//[X] Algorithm to generate new generations of cells correctly implemented

//[X] At least 3 features from Custom Features section successfully implemented



// Custom Features (3 MPV and 5 Stretch)

//[] Create a few sample cell configurations that users can load and run

//[X] Add an option that creates a random cell configuration that users can run

//[X] Add additional cell properties, like color or size, and incorporate them into your visualization

//[X] Allow users to specify the speed of the simulation

//[X] Provide functionality to manually step through the simulation one generation at a time, as opposed to animating automatically

//[X] Allow users to change the dimension of the grid being displayed

//[] Given a specific generation, calculate the configuration of cells at that point in time, and jump to that state, bypassing animation (i.e. skip ahead n generations).
